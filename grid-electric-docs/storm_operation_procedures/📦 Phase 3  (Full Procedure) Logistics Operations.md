# Storm Mobilization Logistics Procedure

## Purpose

To outline the procedures and responsibilities for managing contractor travel, lodging, meals, fuel, and safety compliance during the mobilization phase of storm operations.

## Scope

This procedure applies to all [[Grid Electric]] personnel involved in coordinating logistics during storm events, including travel booking, lodging arrangements, and field readiness requirements.

## Responsibilities

> [!info] Key Personnel
> - **Jeanie** oversees the overall mobilization strategy, confirms [[NTP]] status, and supports decision-making regarding travel.
> - **The Admin** is responsible for booking flights, lodging, and vehicles, collecting & verifying insurance, continual communication with/ contractor, and ensuring [[Life360]] compliance.
> - **Contractors** must comply with onboarding, [[Life360]] tracking, and documentation requirements.

## Procedure

> [!airplane] Step 1: Book Airfare (If Required)

Flights may be booked only after the customer has approved the [[NTP]] or provided written mobilization authorization.

Use [[Grid's corporate travel portal]] or login credentials (found in [[StormDat Team Notebook]]). Always apply the assigned [[Project Code]].

All confirmations must be emailed to: [[stormdat@gridelectriccorp.com]]

> [!car] Step 2: Secure Rental Vehicles

- Admin will book rental vehicles through [[Enterprise Fleet]] or [[National]] using [[Grid's corporate account number]]. Contractors must:
	- Select all insurance options (Liability and Comp/Collision) at pickup—this cannot be applied after the fact.
	- Submit proof via screenshot or photo.
- Confirm availability with the Enterprise rep ([[Tyler]]).
- Ensure the [[Project Code]] is entered at the time of booking.

> [!hotel] Step 3: Confirm Lodging Strategy

Lodging arrangements depend on the client and region, and we will discuss with the customer closer to the show-up date and time:

> [!example] Regional Lodging Contacts
> - **[[Oncor]] (TX)**: Use [[Storm Revival]] contact ([[Gabrielle]]), ensuring our rewards hotel corporate/member ID is used.
> - **[[FPL]] & [[Duke]] (FL and Carolinas)**: Lodging is provided by the utility.
> - **[[Northeast Utilities]]**: Lodging policies vary—check with [[Jeanie]].
> - **[[Mancamps]]**: If provided by the utility, alternative hotel stays will not be reimbursed.

Use the [[Lodging Tracker]] to log hotel name, address, check-in/out dates, and assigned contractors.

> [!food] Step 4: Process Meal Reimbursements

- Meal reimbursements follow the declared [[per diem]] rate for the event. Contractors must:
	- Submit legible receipts—no alcohol or unauthorized items.
	- Follow instructions for [[Mancamp]] situations—no reimbursements unless meals were unavailable and documented.

> [!location] Step 5: Verify Life360 Is ON

All contractors must:

- Install [[Life360]] and set it to "Always On" for location tracking.
- Stay live on [[Life360]] during all travel and throughout their assignment. This is critical for both safety and billing verification.

> [!check] Step 6: Finalize New Contractor Onboarding

Contractors who are new or haven't onboarded must:

- Complete safety training via [[YouTube link]].
- Sign and return onboarding documents via [[Adobe Sign]].
- Travel is not authorized until onboarding is verified complete by the Admin.
