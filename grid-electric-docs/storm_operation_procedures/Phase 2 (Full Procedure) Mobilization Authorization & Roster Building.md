# Phase 2: Mobilization Authorization

## 🔹 What Triggers This Phase

Phase 2 begins when [[Grid Electric]] receives verbal authorization to mobilize from the customer.

This typically includes:

1. A phone call or email from the client confirming they are authorizing mobilization.
2. [[Jeanie]] prepares and sends the [[NTP]] (Notice to Proceed) to the customer for formal signature or signs the customers contract.

> [!info] What is a Notice to Proceed (NTP)?
> 
> The NTP is a formal document created by [[Grid Electric]] that includes:
> 
> 1. Billing terms and storm rates
> 2. Authorized expense details
> 3. Expected arrival times and mobilization commitments
> 4. Points of contact and response requirements

> [!warning] Deployment does not begin until Jeanie receives written authorization back from the client. In some cases, a clearly written confirmation (email or text) may be accepted if timing is critical. This decision is at [[Jeanie]]'s discretion and must be documented.

> [!danger] Storm Deployment is High Pressure
> 
> This phase moves quickly and under pressure. The customer may request changes on short notice, personnel may drop out unexpectedly, and mistakes can be costly.
> 
> 🛑 **Document everything.** Save all email confirmations, screenshot text approvals, and record verbal commitments in writing. Admins must protect the company by maintaining accurate records and providing timely updates.

> [!clock] Resource Planning Reminder
> 
> Initial resource estimation happens in [[Phase 1]]. [[Jeanie]]:
> 
> 1. Reviews [[MS Forms]] signups
> 2. Sorts by travel zone and availability
> 3. Responds to the customer with approximate crew counts
> 
> Phase 2 is about locking in the teams, confirming availability, and deploying.

## 🔹 Jeanie's Responsibilities

### 1. Roster Finalization

- Review [[Resource Assignments]]
- Confirm team selections from [[MS Forms]] responses
- Review no-shows, assign backups, and ensure team count matches what was quoted
- **Team Pairing** - Match up singles by location, coordination, and personalities.
	- Encourage shared travel where appropriate
- Emails the final roster version to the client
- Saves a copy to: [[Storm Dat SharePoint]] > [[Rosters]] > [[Submitted Roster]]

> [!tip] Storm Workbook Version Control
> 
> Use the existing [[Storm Workbook]] (created in [[Phase 1]]) to and add the final submitted roster to the first tab and use subsequent tabs (Rev 1, Rev 2, etc.)
> 
> Each roster update gets a new tab (Rev 1, Rev 2, etc.) and is locked for accidental edits. This ensures we can trace every change from the original to the current.

### 3. Send our NTP or Customer Storm Contract

---

## 🔹 Admin Responsibilities

### 1. Follow-Ups & Communication

- Message contractors not responding and remove after 2–3 failed contact attempts; note on roster as "No Contact"

### 3. Adobe Onboarding Documents

- Access the onboarding templates by going to [[Adobe Template Agreements]](https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/documents/agreements/?locale=en-US#agreement_type=template).
- Then prefill the sections using the following steps:
	- In [[Adobe Acrobat]], go to eSign → Request e-signatures.
	- Select the template titled `YY_MM_DD_Complete_Onboarding`.
	- Rename the file using the format: `YY_MM_DD_Complete_Onboarding_First_Last`; (Example: `25_10_10_Complete_Onboarding_John_Doe`)
	- Create a new agreement and enter:
		- Contractor's email address
		- Start date
		- Job role
		- Hourly rate
- Once the completed onboarding document is received, create a contractor folder under [[Storm DAT SharePoint]] > [[HR]] > [[Contractors]] and save the signed onboarding file there.
- Confirm the folder includes both the signed onboarding file and any identification or certification documents if applicable.

### 5. Apps & Onboarding

- Send the [[Life360]] App Invite Code to all active storm personnel and confirm they successfully join the correct group.
	- Tracking must remain active at all times while deployed.
	- See [[Life360 Setup & Tracking SOP]] (Section 5) for full instructions.

### 1. Rental Vehicles (After receiving a SIGNED NTP)

- Use [[Enterprise]] or [[National]] with [[Grid's corporate account]]
- Contact our [[Enterprise rep]] to verify availability before confirming.
- Enter the correct [[Project Code]] and billing code
- Instruct contractors to select all insurance at pickup (Collision, Liability, Comprehensive)
- Require photo/screenshot proof sent to Admin

### 3. Lodging

**Scope:** Lodging may be:

- Customer-provided (hotels or man camps), or
- [[GEC]] responsibility (contract specifies at storm start).

**Booking Process (when GEC is responsible):**

- Lodging is booked through [[Revival Storm Lodging Solutions]] ([[Gabrielle]] – see [[Resources]] for phone number).
- Admin provides [[Gabrielle]] with required rooms (singles vs doubles).
- Target rate: $130/night whenever possible.
- Use company rewards/points; provide [[Gabrielle]] with account information.

> [!rules] Room Assignment Rules
> 
> - Mandatory double occupancy unless approved.
> - Managers always receive single rooms.
> - Men and women are not roomed together unless they are a couple or have written approval.

- **Documentation:** Create a spreadsheet with lodging assignments and room numbers then save to [[Storm DAT SharePoint]] > [[Logistics]] > [[Lodging]].

> [!risk] ⚠️ Risk Note
> 
> Lodging details may not be known until last-minute or end of the day. Crews must remain flexible. Admin must confirm with [[Jeanie]] whether lodging is customer-provided or GEC-responsible for each storm. ⚠️

### 1. Airfare

- Book only with approved [[Grid portals]] or logins
- Email all confirmations and receipts to: [[stormdat@gridelectriccorp.com]]
- Use the [[workbook]] to track pay advances, flight info, and lodging notes as needed

### 3. Create or activate the contractor's [[Timesheet.com]] login.

- See [[Contractor Timesheet Setup Guide]] (Section 5) for setup and submission steps.
